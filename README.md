# Ebay Scraper 

This appication scrapes ebay's auction for laptops.  The user may then annotate items s/he is interested in and delete those that s/he is not interested in.  Confirmation is requred via a confirm/cancel arrangement.  New items maybe fetched by a get items button.  All items can be cleared using a "clear all" button, which does just that.  This feature includes a timer-based confirmation button.   Annotation notes may also be deleted.
